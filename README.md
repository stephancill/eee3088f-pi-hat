Mixing and visualizing analog audio input. The HAT will have an audio input which will be processed by a series of subsystems e.g. EQ and volume controls and indicators and will be outputted on an analog audio output which will be accessible to the Pi as well. 

## Usage
The HAT attaches to the Pi, which has access to the input and output signals and a speaker could be plugged into the output of the HAT in order to play the processed input.

Could be used as a low cost recording device or could be used as a pre-processor for some digital audio processing or could be used as a testing device to ensure that an audio output is working as expected.
